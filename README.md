# NBA Dream Team

## Description 

The NBA Dream Team app will allow users to create a profile. In their profile, they will be able to create custom teams and define their favorite players.

## User Stories
- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault

- **500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault

- **landing page** - As a user I want to see a sign in and sign up feature so that I can access my profile

- **sign up** - As a user I want to sign up with an email, username, and password

- **sign in** - As a user I want to be able to input my credentials (username and password) and be redirected to my profile

- **profile** - As a user I want to be able to submit profile picture, and miscellaneous information about my username
                Here, I want to search for players and add them to one of my teams. I want my teams and favorite players to be featured here as well.
